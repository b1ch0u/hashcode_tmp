x[o, p, w] -> how much or order o and product p is provided from warehouse w


CONSTANTS
c[w, p] initial number of product p in warehouse w
q[o, p] quantity of product p in order o
d[o, w] distance between order o and warehouse w


SUCH THAT
# all quantities are positive
for all o, p, w, 0 <= x[o, p, w]

# a warehouse can not provide more of a product than is has in stock
for all p and w, sum(x[o, p, w] for o in orders) <= c[w, p]

# do not deliver
for all o and p, sum(x[o, p, w] for w in warehouses) <= q[o, p]


MINIMIZE

sum(d[o, w, p] for all o, w, p)
